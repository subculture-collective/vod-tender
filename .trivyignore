# Trivy Ignore File - Baseline Allowlist
# Use this file to suppress specific vulnerabilities that have been reviewed and accepted
# Format: CVE-ID or vulnerability ID per line
#
# Example:
# CVE-2023-12345
# GHSA-xxxx-yyyy-zzzz
#
# Guidelines:
# - Only add vulnerabilities after thorough review and risk assessment
# - Document the reason for each exception with a comment
# - Periodically review and remove fixed vulnerabilities
# - Consider setting an expiration date for temporary exceptions
#
# To ignore a vulnerability with expiration:
# CVE-2023-12345 # expires: 2024-12-31 (not enforced by Trivy) - Waiting for upstream fix
