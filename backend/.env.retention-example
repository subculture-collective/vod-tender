# Retention Policy Example Configuration
# Add these to your backend/.env file or environment variables

# Example 1: Keep last 30 days
RETENTION_KEEP_DAYS=30

# Example 2: Keep last 100 VODs
RETENTION_KEEP_COUNT=100

# Example 3: Hybrid - Keep 14 days OR last 50 VODs (whichever is more permissive)
RETENTION_KEEP_DAYS=14
RETENTION_KEEP_COUNT=50

# Example 4: Testing with dry-run (recommended before going live)
RETENTION_KEEP_DAYS=30
RETENTION_DRY_RUN=1

# Optional: Customize cleanup interval (default: 6h)
RETENTION_INTERVAL=12h

# Notes:
# - At least one policy (KEEP_DAYS or KEEP_COUNT) must be set for retention to run
# - When both are set, VODs matching EITHER policy are retained (union)
# - DRY_RUN=1 logs what would be deleted without actually deleting
# - The retention job runs automatically in the background
# - VODs being downloaded/uploaded are automatically protected from deletion
# - Database metadata is never deleted, only local video files
