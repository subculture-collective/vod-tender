## Problem Statement

vod-tender currently encrypts OAuth tokens at rest using AES-256-GCM, but the Data Encryption Key (DEK) is stored directly in environment variables. This creates several security and operational challenges:

- **Security Gap**: DEK visible to anyone with access to container orchestrator (Kubernetes, Docker)
- **Compliance Gap**: SOC 2, HIPAA, and PCI DSS audits typically require centralized Key Management Service
- **Operational Risk**: Key rotation requires manual process with potential downtime
- **Audit Gap**: No trail of who decrypted tokens when
- **Multi-tenant Risk**: Single DEK for all environments/channels

---

## Proposed Solution

**Implement envelope encryption using AWS KMS** as the Key Encryption Key (KEK) provider.

### How Envelope Encryption Works

## Approach Comparison Summary

| Approach | Security | Ops Complexity | Cost/month | Compliance | Recommendation |
|----------|----------|----------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **AWS KMS** (Recommended) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Medium | $1.50 | ✅ Best | **✅ Use for production** |
| GCP KMS | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Medium | $2.50 | ✅ Good | Use if on GCP |
| HashiCorp Vault | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | High | $5-50 | ⚠️ Good | Use if multi-cloud |
| age + sops | ⭐⭐⭐ | Low | $0 | ❌ No | Dev/staging only |
| Hybrid (local envelope) | ⭐⭐⭐ | High | $0 | ❌ No | Not recommended |

**Winner: AWS KMS** - Best balance of security, operational maturity, and auditability

---

## Key Benefits

### Security Improvements
- ✅ **KEK never leaves AWS KMS** (stored in FIPS 140-2 Level 3 HSM)
- ✅ **Audit trail**: CloudTrail logs every decrypt operation (who, when, which key)
- ✅ **Insider threat mitigation**: DevOps engineers cannot read tokens without IAM permissions + audit log
- ✅ **Multi-tenant isolation**: Separate KMS key per channel/environment
- ✅ **Automatic key rotation**: AWS manages key material rotation yearly

### Compliance Benefits
- ✅ **SOC 2 Type II**: Satisfies centralized key management requirement
- ✅ **HIPAA**: HSM-backed encryption meets HIPAA technical safeguards
- ✅ **PCI DSS**: Automated key rotation + audit logs satisfy PCI requirements

### Operational Benefits
- ✅ **Zero-downtime migration**: Dual-mode operation (read v1 and v2, write v2)
- ✅ **Easy key rotation**: Re-encrypt DEK with new KEK (fast, no data re-encryption)
- ✅ **Disaster recovery**: Multi-region KMS keys + 30-day deletion window
- ✅ **Minimal performance impact**: <10% latency increase with DEK caching

## Cost Analysis

| Component | One-Time | Monthly | Annual |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| AWS KMS CMK (1 key) | - | $1.00 | $12.00 |
| KMS API calls (~5k/month) | - | $0.15 | $1.80 |
| Development effort (40 hours) | $4,000 | - | - |
| Testing & validation | $1,000 | - | - |
| **Total Year 1** | **$5,000** | **$1.15** | **$5,014** |
| **Recurring (Year 2+)** | - | **$1.15** | **$13.80** |

**ROI**: If SOC 2 audit costs $20k-50k and KMS is a required control, the $5k investment pays for itself immediately. Annual recurring cost of $14 is negligible.

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Phase | Effort | Risk |
|------|-------|--------|------|
| Week 1 | AWS KMS setup (Terraform) | 1 day | Low |
| Week 2 | Crypto package implementation | 2 days | Medium |
| Week 3 | DB schema + migration script | 1.5 days | Medium |
| Week 4 | Monitoring + documentation | 1.5 days | Low |
| Week 5-6 | Staging validation | 1 week | Medium |
| Week 7-8 | Production rollout | 1 week | High |

**Total**: 8 weeks (can compress to 4 weeks with full-time dedication)

---

## Migration Strategy (Zero-Downtime)

### Phase 1: Deploy Dual-Mode Code (Week 1)
```bash
# Deploy code that reads v1 (direct AES) and v2 (KMS envelope)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<existing-key>  # Keep for backward compat
# KMS_KEY_ID not set yet
```

### Phase 2: Enable KMS for New Tokens (Week 1)
```bash
# New tokens use KMS, old tokens still readable
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<existing-key>
KMS_KEY_ID=alias/vod-tender-prod
```

### Phase 3: Migrate Existing Tokens (Week 2)
```bash
# Background script: Decrypt with AES, re-encrypt with KMS
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- /app/migrate-tokens
```

### Phase 4: Remove Legacy Key (Week 3)
```bash
# All tokens now KMS-encrypted, remove old key
KMS_KEY_ID=alias/vod-tender-prod
# ENCRYPTION_KEY removed
```

**Rollback Plan**: Re-enable `ENCRYPTION_KEY` at any point. Dual-mode supports both formats.

## Security Validation

### Before Migration
- ❌ DEK stored in environment variables (visible in `kubectl describe pod`)
- ❌ No audit trail of token access
- ❌ Manual key rotation (requires downtime)
- ⚠️ Compliance gap for SOC 2/HIPAA audits

### After Migration
- ✅ KEK stored in AWS KMS HSM (FIPS 140-2 Level 3)
- ✅ CloudTrail logs every decrypt operation
- ✅ Automatic key rotation (AWS-managed, yearly)
- ✅ Compliance-ready (SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI DSS)

## Performance Impact

| Metric | Before (Direct AES) | After (KMS Envelope) | Change |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Token encrypt | 0.05ms | 55ms | +54.95ms |
| Token decrypt (cold) | 0.05ms | 60ms | +59.95ms |
| Token decrypt (cached) | 0.05ms | 0.05ms | 0ms |
| Token refresh (end-to-end) | 500ms | 550ms | +10% |

**Mitigation**: DEK caching achieves >90% cache hit rate, reducing KMS API calls by 10x. Typical token refresh still completes in <600ms.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| KMS unavailable during rollout | High | Low | Keep dual-mode for 1 week, gradual rollout |
| Performance degradation >20% | Medium | Low | DEK caching, load test in staging first |
| Migration script fails | High | Medium | Dry-run mode, transaction per token, rollback plan |
| Team unfamiliar with KMS | Medium | High | Training session, detailed runbooks |
| Compliance audit still fails | High | Low | Pre-audit with auditor, validate controls |

**Overall Risk**: **Medium** (well-understood technology, clear rollback plan, proven in other orgs)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why not just use Kubernetes Secrets?
**A**: Kubernetes Secrets are base64-encoded (not encrypted by default). Even with etcd encryption, the key is stored on the control plane. KMS provides HSM-backed encryption with audit logs.

### Q: Can we use this for other secrets (database passwords, API keys)?
**A**: Yes! The crypto package can be extended to encrypt any sensitive data. However, for non-token secrets, consider using External Secrets Operator to fetch directly from KMS/Vault.

### Q: What if AWS has an outage?
**A**: Use multi-region KMS keys for cross-region failover. DEK caching (5-15 min TTL) provides temporary resilience. For catastrophic scenarios, rollback to direct-AES is possible.

### Q: How much does this cost at scale?
**A**: For 10 channels (10 CMKs): $10/month + API costs (~$2/month) = **$12/month total**. Cost scales linearly with channels, not with request volume (thanks to caching).

### Q: Is this overkill for a small project?
**A**: For development/staging, yes—keep using direct-AES. For production, KMS is industry-standard and expected by auditors. The $14/year cost is negligible vs. compliance/security benefits.
